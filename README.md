# Thanwy Youth Meeting

### Faith • Friendship • Growth

A modern, mobile-first Progressive Web App for the **Thanwy Youth Meeting** at **Christ Church (كنيسة المسيح)**.

The platform brings together weekly meeting information, Bible content, games, event photos, prayer requests, push notifications, and administrative tools in one centralized experience.

**Live Website:** https://thanwy.ccen/

## 🧩 Reusable Template for Church Meeting Websites

This repository doubles as a **template**: the code defines how the website
works, while the configuration under **`src/config/`** defines which meeting
it represents. A second meeting website can be created by editing
configuration and replacing assets — no component rewrites required.

This repository is the **Thanwy Youth Meeting** instance of that template, so
every default config value (name, church, colors, assets, Cloudinary folder)
is Thanwy's live value.

```text
src/config/
  site.ts        → name, church, description, social links, contact, assets, Cloudinary folder
  theme.ts       → brand colors + background gradients (drives every color on the site)
  meeting.ts     → meeting name, age group, weekly schedule, hero text, About content
  servants.ts    → servants directory
  navigation.ts  → bottom nav, home quick links, More/Bible page items
  features.ts    → feature flags for major optional sections
```

Quick orientation:

- **Core/shared** — pages, components, admin dashboard, integrations
  (Supabase, Cloudinary, OneSignal), schedule logic, theming mechanism.
- **Meeting-specific** — `src/config/*`, `messages/{ar,en}.json` (UI labels),
  `public/` branding assets (logo, app icon, PWA splash screens, servants
  photos), and `.env` credentials.
- **Environment-specific** — `.env.local` (see `.env.example`): Supabase,
  Cloudinary, OneSignal, admin password, cron secret, site URL.

| 📜 History | View notification history and recipient counts |
| 🙏 Prayer | Approve, reject, and delete prayer requests |

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

The application supports both:

- 🇪🇬 Arabic
- 🇬🇧 English

The interface automatically supports the appropriate text direction:

- **RTL** for Arabic
- **LTR** for English

Internationalization is implemented using [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/).

Translation resources are maintained in:

```text
messages/
├── ar.json
└── en.json
```

---

## 🔎 SEO & Discoverability

Metadata comes from `src/config` (site title, per-locale description,
application name, Open Graph / Twitter cards, canonical URL + `hreflang`
alternates for each locale).

Generated automatically:

- `/sitemap.xml` — every public page for every locale, gated by the feature
  flags in `src/config/features.ts`
- `/robots.txt` — allows the public site, disallows `/admin` and `/api/`
- `/manifest.webmanifest` — PWA manifest with the brand theme colors and icons

---

## 📱 Progressive Web App

Thanwy is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, allowing users to access the meeting platform like a native application.

The project includes:

- Web App Manifest (generated from `src/config` at `/manifest.webmanifest`)
- App icons + iOS startup (splash) images
- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Installable experience
- Push notification support
- Responsive navigation

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Node.js
- npm
- A Supabase project
- A Cloudinary account
- A OneSignal application

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelMansour256/thanwy.ccen.git
cd thanwy.ccen
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=
ONESIGNAL_API_KEY=

ADMIN_PASSWORD=
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API access |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase public API key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` | OneSignal application ID |
| `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY` | OneSignal REST API key |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin dashboard password |

> **Security:** Never commit `.env.local` or expose private API keys such as `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` or `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`.

---

### 4. Configure Supabase

The project uses Supabase for persistent application data.

The main database features include:

- Prayer requests
- Notification history
- Moderation status
- Prayer counters
- Notification metadata

The repository includes:

```text
supabase-notifications-history.sql
```

for configuring the notification history table.

Make sure Row Level Security policies are configured appropriately for your deployment.

---

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧪 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates a production build.

```bash
npm run start
```

Starts the production server.

```bash
npm run lint
```

Runs ESLint.

These scripts are defined in the project's `package.json`.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

The application is deployed using **Vercel**.

Production deployments are connected to the repository's `main` branch.

To deploy successfully, make sure all required environment variables are configured in:

**Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables**

> **Note:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are inlined into the bundle at build time,
> so they must exist in the **Production** scope before the build runs. When one
> of them is missing, the failure appears during the build (for example
> `supabaseUrl is required.`) rather than at runtime. Supabase is therefore
> created lazily in `src/lib/supabase.ts`: the build succeeds even without it,
> and the prayer wall / notification history answer `503 Supabase is not
> configured` until the variables are set.

The application is currently available at:

https://thanwy.ccen/

---

## 🔒 Security

The application contains several server-side integrations and therefore requires careful handling of secrets.

### Never expose:

```text
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
ONESIGNAL_API_KEY
ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Public client-side configuration may include:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
```

Supabase Row Level Security should remain enabled for tables containing user-generated content or administrative data.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The platform is built around three central values:

### Faith

Encouraging young people to grow in their relationship with God and engage with Scripture.

### Friendship

Creating a digital space that strengthens community and connection within the meeting.

### Growth

Providing resources, activities, games, and opportunities that encourage spiritual and personal growth.
